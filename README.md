# ðŸ’¤ churrer's lazyvim config

this is my very own neovim config, it's a bit of a mess, but it works.

## setup

1. install neovim
2. clone this repo into `~/.config/nvim` folder
3. change the `username` in `lua/plugins/codestats.lua` to your codestats username
4. set `CODESTATS_API_KEY` with your codestats api key in `env-vars.sh` or `env-vars.ps1`
5. set `NVIM_SHELL` to your preferred shell path in `env-vars.sh` or `env-vars.ps1`
6. run `source env-vars.sh` or `env-vars.ps1` to set the environment variables
